Did you manage to try it yet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of Crowdin customers did, and after observing thousands of successfully localized projects we realized that it would be great to analyze some accumulated experience on how to motivate volunteers and share it with our precious readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some ideas we came up with in getting all this tricky motivation organization without a lot of efforts and money wasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Rewards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure,we think of voluntary crowdsourcing translations as of free translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing in life is for free, thought. Probably the one of the most determinative factors for the&nbsp;crowdsourcing&nbsp;translators are bonuses. Think what can be free for you but is so valuable for a contributors. You can offer one month free usage of your application, invitation for some event at your office or sweet &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; card (which is not so monetary, but pleasant anyway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example one of our customers eMagicOne company are giving FREE Primary Licenses to those who do the best native language translations in their project Store Manager for PrestaShop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, translators that are patient enough to translate new versions of a software over again is getting 3 - 6 month of free update service. A little effort is making awesome results and great motivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Acknowledgment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody loves compliments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t you think your volunteers would you like to be rewarded with a big noticeable &ldquo;best translator&rdquo; image at your app background? :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah yeah, probably I have exaggerated it a bit. But still&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People need to understand that their work is appreciated. Apart from external motivators such as free licenses, free service updates, gifts, etc volunteer should be internally motivated and eager to participate. This can range from desire to share language skills and aspiration to be recognized within community to an ambition in developing talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most successful online sites create an internal motivation for crowdsourcers, such as possibility to show off and get some acknowledgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking about crowdsourcing in translations here is the concept: make your translators be proud of themselves and they will come back over and over again. Separate app screen or web page with names of best contributors will bring joy and high self-esteem to your translators lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. New experience and reciprocity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receiving something in exchange for an effort, is crucial - balance should be kept despite of any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crowdsourced translations are not just routine job it is also an involvement of personal energy and language skills. Give your translators a right to be an expert in their language, possibility to develop their skills and get the best form the crowdsourcing experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teach, give recommendations and feedback about the software translations criteria. Ask your certain language proofreaders to tutor same language translators make their best while translating. Once your people feel they are really learning you will get reliable contributors and they will get precious reciprocity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Fun</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To attract the crowd you can make process of translation to become a game like. Can you imagine how your contributors compete against each other in a world of Star Wars? The most productive volunteer will get the title of&nbsp;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.crowdin.net%2Fpost%2F56342459316%2Fjuly-at-crowdin&amp;t=MTBjNjRlOTMxYmYwMjQxM2JmYTU1N2VjZGEyMDdiNjNmMWZiNjlkMixtZ3U5R3ZFcQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">Crowdin C-3PO</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit of competition will motivate volunteers for the better results. Also it will make the translation process fun and interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow the example of Google Image Labeler that created some label game, where the user get points for trying to guess what way the others will label the same image. It turned incredibly boring process into something fun and exciting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone needs to belong, it is an internal psychological need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regard all the translators aspiration to have your software in their language, strongly support language-patriotic points of view, get all of the participants feel as they belong to something bigger and exceptionally valuable. Treat your crowdsourcers as a family and they will treat you this way back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay attention to these motivational approaches and you will attract more translators to your project and reach visible results faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find an article interesting?

Pre-Translate via Google Translate or Microsoft Translator&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible now to pre-translate files via machine translation engine and let translators only correct the suggestions. In some cases the feature simplifies the translation process and get all the preliminary work done before the actual translations begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="image" src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/3583a2b51fd94793ddb274bbc57b77e3/tumblr_inline_ms71pnAdHr1qz4rgp.png" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Multilingual Spreadsheet files support (xlsx, csv)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Crowdin supports localization of multilingual spreadsheets that are so popular in game dev industry and not only there. Developers that work with CSV and XLSX files can forget their hard times with all the numerous language archives - there is no need to merge them anymore, they are already in a single file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, overall support of spreadsheet files has been significantly improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="image" src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/11ce46f19dd931560ad853cb2ac73889/tumblr_inline_ms71rbwZMn1qz4rgp.png" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.

But the tool knows what part of the app is translatable and provides all of the means to let translator localize in-context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The translation process is accomplished via &nbsp;minimized regular Crowdin translation page with all the functionalities(proofread/vote option, comments, terms, etc). Additionally it is easy to review translations for proofreaders and assure quality for QAs that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t4Rvn0SP_0Q11fZtmi65isvqSrN-gMc21EaXDI0FEIbZMMbtKFpaJWKMLHc2njcSsi0hdSwWYaXz2Z3-nl4hlO9a2jqb3xaSasi7Mj-kmT2cLesS7lZRuF4TuQ" style="height:360px; width:624px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best part of this approach is that it&rsquo;s technology independent. If you can localize your web application with Crowdin, you can do so with JIPT. The approach also does not involve proxy servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is moreover it is possible to localize dynamic parts of the application: dynamic dialogs and messages that appear in the runtime.

No coding, no heavy changes in your application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, Crowdin is the only provider of such solution since it is based on the patent pending technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you subscribe to our blog to see what is coming next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2016-09-08 22:01:44', 2),

Observing their success in managing translation projects for mobile application, we decided to talk to Chess.com localization leader Erik and summarize a good localization practice into short overview easy to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The functionality of Chess.com home grown localization solution was not enough to cover translation environment and the translation software low input threshold, so they started to look for way round which stumbled them onto Crowdin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea was simple: to find the place where Chess. com huge community can work together to translate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking little steps they started with Android mobile app around 2000 words in total.&nbsp;<strong>The project was translated in over 40 languages for less than 3 weeks. Now 196 contributors are taking part, the number of translated languages reached 53 languages and counting.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Erik to outline top three features that Chess.com loved about our solution the most and which can be a real aid in managing similar localization projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An answer was:<br />\r\n&ldquo;&hellip;1) Amazing User interface (the progress is visible, and the users like it a lot);<br />\r\n2) All of the features I could want for accountability and reporting;<br />\r\n3) Easy import/export functionality&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is really flattering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why did Chess.com decide to let end users take care about localization ?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For us, we need community members because they know the names of our products and also very specific chess vocabulary. We tried another service before with &ldquo;professional&rdquo; translators and the translations made no sense to chess players. &rdquo; - says Erik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emphasizes the crucial importance of translators competence in specific software terminology and the layouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approaches Chess.com used to motivate volunteers are quite uncomplicated. They simply &nbsp;invited people to apply to be translators and then chose the best ones. As Erik indicated: &ldquo;Community members are doing it for the love of the game, for the community and their friends, for free memberships, and for some cash :)&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summarizing Chess.com experience here are some numbers that shows the dynamics of localization process:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Project Type:&nbsp;</strong>mobile app</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Project contributors:&nbsp;</strong>196</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Completed target language:&nbsp;</strong>53</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time spent:&nbsp;</strong>4 weeks</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Costs:&nbsp;</strong>$29 per month&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Total cost:&nbsp;</strong>$29</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translators salary:&nbsp;</strong>acknowledgment,&nbsp;free memberships,&nbsp;recognition among community</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison to localization via translation agency the total cost is approximately 8 times bigger per single language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So savings for Chess.com project is somewhere around $200 per language and $10600 per whole project so far, excluding languages that are still under translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crowdsourced localization main benefits:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- speedy translations;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- cost reduce;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- reactivity: newly added texts are being translated within hours;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- increase users loyalty and engagement;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- translations made by experts of the specific software area;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- lots of target languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Chess.com planning to move forward with localization to other projects via crowdsourcing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, next step would be an IOS application and the web application itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Crowdin can be a fair assistance to automate translations migration across mobile apps and in-context localization for web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish Erik and the community a lucky break. Hope a good example will be followed and reproduced by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n', '2016-09-08 22:02:45', 1),
